# Fluid Booking Form UX/UI

A Pen created on CodePen.

Original URL: [https://codepen.io/chriscec/pen/MYKBXVN](https://codepen.io/chriscec/pen/MYKBXVN).

I wanted to make a complicated booing process as simple and frictionless as possible. I used fluid animations to keep the relative locations of information easy to understand. It is just a concept so some functionality such as selecting months etc is missing. Feedback on how to improve welcomed

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

`npm run build` compiles:

- `src/index.pug` → `dist/index.html`
- `src/style.scss` → `dist/style.css`
- `src/script.js` → `dist/script.js`

Use `npm run watch:html` or `npm run watch:css` to recompile individual assets while working.
